# Post Submission Process

## 1. You're selected to cover one or more talks

If you're reading this repo, this is more than likely happened. If you want to apply to liveblog, checkout [this post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-liveblogging-at-gophercon-2018) to see which talks are still available.

## 2. Get your post to us

While you'll be creating your content locally, the way you'll get the content to us is via a repo issue. Why?

It's the easiest way to get your content to us without going through the fork, commit, push, pull-request flow. You also get the benefit of drag-and-drop image to image URL creation.

1. Create an issue, setting the name to the name of the presentation.
1. Presuming there's no broken links or images, we'll close the issue.
1. Our team will then put your content on the liveblog and once live, the [Sourcegraph Twitter](https://twitter.com/srcgraph) account will send out a tweet promoting your post. You'll be tagged in the post to alert you that your post is live.

## 3. Celebrate and be rewarded!

Rejoice! Celebrate your contribution to the conference and the golang community.

As as reward, come and see someone wearing a Sourcegraph shirt and they will get you a Sourcegraph shirt or swag of your choice.

## 4. (Optional) Further promote your post

You've worked hard on your post so you'll want to get the most value out of it. Some ideas to do this are:

 - Quote a retweet the link to your liveblog post to your Twitter audience including the `#gophercon` hashtag.
 - Get your post submitted to HackerNews, the golang Subredit or Lobsters.
 - Share your post Gophers slack workspace in the relevant channel.
 - Post on LinkedIn with a link to the liveblog.

Please resist the urge to spam your post as that may end up hurting the good work you've done. We suggest choosing a couple of channels that you feel will give your post the biggest reach.
